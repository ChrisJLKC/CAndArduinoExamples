# CAndArduinoExamples
In this repository is all the files that I could find which are coded in the past 2 years, which are also all coded in C and C++, with an Arduino and a STM32429ZI board. Most of the Arduino code doesn't use libraries and so it is coded on a basic level. On the other hand, the Snake Game in development doesn't use libraries and the buggies do you use the Mbed library.
